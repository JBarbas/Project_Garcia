tutDACINT2=Adopt a pose when you are near a pedestal, the guards will confuse you with the statue that took your place.
tutDACINT3=You will often find yourself in need of hiding in the most conventional places. Do planking on a table and, as far as the guardsare concerned, you will have vanished!
tutDACEQTitle=Equipable Devices of Unintelligent CloacKing
tutDACEQ1=You will not always be able to rely on the environment, sometimes it will be necessary to use an EQUIPABLE DUCK. Equip yourself with a Zero Gravity's cap, the guards don't know very well who works there and who doesn't, and when they see you with the company cap you will seem someone important to them.
tutDACEQ2=When you cannot avoid capture, if you carry a laser pointer, you may blind the guards and escape.
tutDACEQ3=The DuckShoes are the top-notch in technology. They emit a duck's croaking, which will allow you to take control of a flock of ducks, as long as you move inside their area, as they are very territorial animals. As long as the ducks follow you, you will be invisible to the eyes of the enemies.
tutENETitle=The enemy...
tutENE1=ZG guards are simple fellows hired through front companies. They do not know very well what they do there, nor if they get paid, and this is why they are always in a bad mood. Pay attention to your movements, all noise will attract them.
tutENE2=The ZG team, formed by the most diverse, machiavellian and malevolent entities, will also be an obstacle to overcome. They are more effective than the guards, and use special skills that they must have obtained, without a doubt, from one of those violent video games.
tutENE3=Last but not least, be aware of the mastermind behind everything... ¡The patrón!
